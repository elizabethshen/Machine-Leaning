# Machine-Learning

This repository is a collection of Machine Leaning Algorithms which I have learned and practiced, from the IBM Professional Data Science certificate program.
 <br>

A general overview of Machine Learning topics such as **supervised vs unsupervised learning,  model evaluation, and Machine Learning algorithms**, the pros and cons of each method, and different classification accuracy metrics.<br>

Projects include cancer detection, predicting economic trends, predicting customer churn, recommendation engines, and more.<br>
